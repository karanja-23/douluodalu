                <h3>Welcome to the Douluo Universe!</h3>
                <img src="./media/dd.png"/>
                <p>The Doulou Universe was perhaps created in a collision of a big bang, which is what is called <i>'the end of destruction is creation'</i>.
                    It is a vast and mysterious place that not many people know everything about it, including the God Kings. It is governed by some kind of will similar to the planer lords that govern a planet known as the universal laws or principles and it also has a lifespan.
                    It is the home of many gods, beasts, humans, and animals who anchor and fuse themselves so they won't be suppressed by the higher-dimensional universe that they reside in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Martial souls</strong> are an something that everybody on the Douluo Continent posseses and can naturally be awakened at the age of six.
                    <i>A martial soul could be anything</i>, from a tool to an animal. Beast-type martial souls were referred to as <strong>Beast Souls</strong>, while all other martial souls that weren’t Beast Souls were collectively known as <strong>Tool Souls</strong>. 
                    After the awakening of one’s martial soul, a small amount of people would have a special power along with their martial soul. This power is called <strong>soul force</strong>.
                    Only people who possessed soul force have the ability to <i>cultivate</i>, and to become the noblest profession on the Douluo Continent, a <strong>soul master</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Soul masters are separated into nine different ranks. From lowest to highest, they are: <i>Soul Scholar, Soul Master, Soul Grandmaster, Soul Elder, Soul Ancestor, Soul King, Soul Emperor, Soul Sage, Soul Douluo, and Titled Douluo</i>.
                    Soul masters would increase in power as their soul rank increased. If one managed to reach the highest level of the Titled Douluo rank, one would have the terrifying ability to both move the mountains and seas, as well as even shift the stars.
                    People who are between the first and tenth rank of soulforce fell underneath the category of Soul Scholar. When someone’s martial soul is awakened, their innate soulforce would signify their talent towards becoming a soul master. 
                    As such, a person with greater talent would have a greater cultivation speed. If one had tenth-ranked soulforce after their martial soul had awakened, they would be a gifted person with <strong>innate full soulforce </strong>. That person would thus be referred to as a genius soul master. A genius soul master will have great accomplishments in his life as long as his martial soul wasn’t too bad.

                </p>
                <p>Outside of the two main categories of martial souls, there was an extremely tiny subcategory that are known as <strong>Body Souls</strong>. The martial soul that they awakened would be a part of their body, such as an arm, or a leg.
                    Almost all Body Souls are extremely strong, but the probability of them appearing is extremely small. It could be said that they are existences above both Beast Souls and Tool Souls, and because of this, they are greatly valued whenever they appear.
                    Whenever a soul master’s cultivation reaches the tenth soul rank’s bottleneck, they will need to kill a <strong>soul beast</strong> that is compatible with their martial soul, and then use its soul ring to break through it.

                <p>Ordinary Soul Rings are divided into five levels: <strong>ten-year soul rings, hundred-year soul rings, thousand-year soul rings, ten thousand-year soul rings, and one hundred thousand-year soul rings</strong>. They need to be obtained by hunting soul beasts when soul masters break through a bottleneck (Rank 10, 20, 30, etc.); which are released following their death, sacrifice, or contract with humans. In addition, <i>only the person who has dealt the killing blow can absorb the soul ring</i>.
                 <strong>God-Level Soul Ring</strong> is a soul ring exclusive to gods or god-ranked soul masters, also called a God Ring or Divine Ring.</p>
                 <p>Soul Rings are usually divided into categories based on their age:</p><br><br>
